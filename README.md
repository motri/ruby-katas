# ruby-katas
A log of my script submitted for various Codewars katas and the eventual improvement on its quality.

Codewars is an incredible tool to practice your coding and have fun while doing it.

As beginner your code will probably be messy and way too slow, but hey, if it gets the job done you are on the right track.
However the more you learn the better your code should be and I am using this repo to keep track of my progress by coming back 
every so often and hopefully improving on my previous solutions.
